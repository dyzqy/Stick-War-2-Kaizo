# Stick-War-2-Kaizo
Play a diffrent version of the campaign which is **A LOT** harder then normal! Enemies have recieved buffs and the game also buffed some aspects for the player + a newly "reworked" tech system that rewards player

electric wall upgrade tech
poison spray upgrade tech
spearton bash but it doesn't suck (4s CD, stuns for 1s, gives 1.5 75% extra damage reduction) 
default block 20% (it was always 20% but there was typo)
